## Retail Data Integration with Snowflake and Azure

In this project, I integrated **Snowflake** with **Azure Data Lake Storage** to build a robust data pipeline for a retail data use case. The pipeline was designed to handle large volumes of retail data efficiently while enabling insightful analysis at multiple stages. Using **Snowflake SQL**, I performed a three-tier analysis process — **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** — to progressively refine and transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Key Highlights:
- **Bronze**: Raw data ingestion and initial cleansing from Azure Data Lake Storage.
- **Silver**: Data transformations and enrichment to create a clean, usable dataset.
- **Gold**: High-level aggregation and complex queries to generate valuable insights for business decision-making.

This project demonstrated my ability to leverage cloud technologies like **Snowflake** and **Azure** for data integration and transformation, enhancing the overall data flow and providing clear, actionable insights for retail operations.
